                    <h2>Creative Engineer based in Liberia</h2>
                    <p>I build products and tell stories for brands who are intentional about improving the future of Africa.
                       Stories are a major way we connect with one another and also with brands. I love to work with brands that have a 
                       real world impact that is more than just having a strong balance sheet. I'm open to expanding my client 
                       base in international markets and seeing what impact we can make together.

                    <h2>KIT and Me</h2>
                    <p>Having an educational system that challenges you to be your best isn't something common in my part of the world.
                    As a person who's driven by excellence, you can imagine how fustrating that can be. I have even had to drop out of college
                    not because I didn't like learn, but because I couldn't imagine myself investing 4 years of my life learning how to
                    be mediocre. As painful as that sounds, it is a hard fact. KIT for me is the perfect program that helps anyone be a world-class software engineer. 
                    You just need to be willing to put in the work.

                    KIT has a project based learning system that makes you apply what you're learning on real life scenarios. It also encourages
                    students to research and become better problem solvers. Whatever you put into the KIT is what you're going to get out. 
                    It is wise therefore, to give it your best.
